## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Delete button doesn't work?

**Check 1: SQL Policy**
- Run the SQL from `supabase_delete_policy.sql`
- Verify in Supabase: Table Editor → food_history → Policies

**Check 2: Console Errors**
- Press F12 to open console
- Look for error messages
- Share any errors for help

**Check 3: Supabase Connection**
- Console should show: `✅ Supabase initialized successfully!`
- If not, check your credentials in `script.js`

### Delete confirmation not showing?

**Solution:**
- Make sure you haven't blocked popups
- Try in a different browser
- Check browser console for errors

### Animation not smooth?

**Solution:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl + F5)
- Try a different browser
- Check if hardware acceleration is enabled

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Setup (Public Delete):
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Allow public delete access" ON food_history
  FOR DELETE USING (true);
```

✅ **Anyone can delete any history item**
⚠️ This is fine for personal use or demos
❌ Not recommended for multi-user apps

### Future Enhancement (Private Delete):

If you add user authentication, you can restrict users to only delete their own history:

```sql
-- Drop public policy first
DROP POLICY "Allow public delete access" ON food_history;

-- Add user-specific policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete own history" ON food_history
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

*Note: Requires adding user authentication (see `SUPABASE_SETUP.md` for auth setup)*
